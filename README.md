# Few-shot news categorization models
Pytorch-Lightning implementation of HSCNN, LEAM and ZAGCNN models for few-shot news categorization, implemented for the internship "Link Prediction in Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Few-shot News Classification".

Note that these python scripts contain the models and the datasets strutures but not the dataset studied during the internship, as it is not public.
